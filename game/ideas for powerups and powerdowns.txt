Hitting the "3 of each" goal seems pretty hard from a creative standpoint with such a simple game. Is it possible we could reduce this?

Ups:
Faster scrolling and character speed
What more can be added? Suddenly spawning more obstacles?

Downs:
Invulnerability to regular obstacles (should we really label them "powerups" and "powerdowns" with this in mind?)
Slower scrolling and character speed
???
